## Question 1

`SELECT` everything from a table

### Solution

SELECT name from genres
```

```
SELECT name, bio, year_started FROM artists
```

## Question 3

SELECT everything from the songs table whose id numbers are even and greater than 50, or odd and less than ten.

### Solution

```
SELECT * from songs WHERE
(id % 2 = 0 AND id > 50) OR
(id % 2 = 1 AND id < 10)
```

## Question 4

`INSERT` ten new records into the `User` table. They can be real or fictional individuals.

```
INSERT INTO User
(
	FirstName,
  	LastName,
  	Birthplace,
  	CreatedAt
)
VALUES
(
	"Mayuko",
  	"Inoue",
  	"Massachusetts, United States",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Maria",
  	"Agnesi",
  	"Milan, Italy",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Yoko",
  	"Taro",
  	"Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Lu",
  	"Yu",
  	"Tianmen, Hubei Province, China",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Terence",
  	"Tao",

(
	"Ai",
  	"Ogawa",
  	"Albany, Texas",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Joseph",
  	"Fourier",
  	"Auxerre, Yonne Department, France",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Question 5

`UPDATE` the `User` table and change some names. When you `UPDATE`, do not forget to put `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` into `UpdatedAt`. That way, you always know when the last update was.

### Solution

```
SELECT * FROM User
```

```
UPDATE User
SET FirstName = "Maria G.",
	UpdatedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE UserID = 6;

UPDATE User
SET FirstName = "Terence 'Terry' Chi-Shen",
	UpdatedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE UserID = 9;

UPDATE User
SET FirstName = "Jean-Baptiste Joseph",
	UpdatedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE UserID = 14;
```

```
SELECT * FROM User
```

## Question 6

Use a `TRANSACTION`/`ROLLBACK` window to `DELETE` everything from the `User` table.

### Solution

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
	DELETE FROM User;
	Select * FROM User;
ROLLBACK;
```

```
SELECT * FROM User;
```

## Question 7

For each user in the `User` table, add a record to the `Favorite` table, but only `INSERT` for UserID (the `FK`), and `CreatedAt`.

### Solution

```
SELECT * FROM Favorite
```

```
INSERT INTO Favorite (userid, createdat)
SELECT userid, createdat FROM User
WHERE true
```

```
SELECT * FROM Favorite
```

## Question 8

Use a `TRANSACTION`/`ROLLBACK` window to `DELETE` everything from the Favorite table `WHERE` the `FavoriteID` is odd, or even but greater than 10.

### Solution

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
	DELETE FROM Favorite WHERE (favoriteid % 2 = 1) OR (favoriteid % 2 = 0 AND favoriteid > 10);
    SELECT * FROM Favorite;
ROLLBACK;
```

## Question 9

Put `SELECT * FROM Favorite` in the window to make sure you delete only those records you should!

### Solution

```
SELECT * FROM Favorite
```
