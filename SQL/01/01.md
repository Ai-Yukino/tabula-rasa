## Question 1

`SELECT` everything from a table

### Solution

```

## Question 2

`SELECT` exactly one column from a table. SELECT more than one but not all columns from a table

### Solution

```
SELECT name from genres
```

```
SELECT name, bio, year_started FROM artists
```

## Question 3

SELECT everything from the songs table whose id numbers are even and greater than 50, or odd and less than ten.

### Solution

```
SELECT * from songs WHERE
(id % 2 = 0 AND id > 50) OR
(id % 2 = 1 AND id < 10)
```

## Question 4

`INSERT` ten new records into the `User` table. They can be real or fictional individuals.

```
INSERT INTO User
(
	FirstName,
  	LastName,
  	Birthplace,
  	CreatedAt
)
VALUES
(
	"Mayuko",
  	"Inoue",
  	"Massachusetts, United States",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Maria",
  	"Agnesi",
  	"Milan, Italy",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Yoko",
  	"Taro",
  	"Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Lu",
  	"Yu",
  	"Tianmen, Hubei Province, China",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Terence",
  	"Tao",
  	"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Hikaru",
  	"Utada",
  	"New York City, New York, United States",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Haruka",
  	"Aikawa",
  	"Suginami ward, Tokyo, Japan",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Satsuki",
  	"Yukino",
  	"Kyoto, Japan",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Ai",
  	"Ogawa",
  	"Albany, Texas",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
(
	"Joseph",
  	"Fourier",
  	"Auxerre, Yonne Department, France",
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Question 5

`UPDATE` the `User` table and change some names. When you `UPDATE`, do not forget to put `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` into `UpdatedAt`. That way, you always know when the last update was.

### Solution

```
SELECT * FROM User
```

```
UPDATE User
SET FirstName = "Maria G.",
	UpdatedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE UserID = 6;

UPDATE User
SET FirstName = "Terence 'Terry' Chi-Shen",
	UpdatedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE UserID = 9;

UPDATE User
SET FirstName = "Jean-Baptiste Joseph",
	UpdatedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE UserID = 14;
```

```
SELECT * FROM User
```

## Question 6

Use a `TRANSACTION`/`ROLLBACK` window to `DELETE` everything from the `User` table.

### Solution

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
	DELETE FROM User;
	Select * FROM User;
ROLLBACK;
```

```
SELECT * FROM User;
```

## Question 7

For each user in the `User` table, add a record to the `Favorite` table, but only `INSERT` for UserID (the `FK`), and `CreatedAt`.

### Solution

```
SELECT * FROM Favorite
```

```
INSERT INTO Favorite
(
	userid,
  	createdat
)
VALUES
(
	1
  	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
),
```
