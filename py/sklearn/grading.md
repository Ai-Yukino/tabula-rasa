# `tabula-rasa/py/plt/grading.md`

- Solution code you can run: `notebooks/{letter}/{letter}.ipynb`
- Non-interactive solutions with code output: `notebooks/{letter}/{letter}.html`
- [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) file format for good `git` version control: `notebooks/{letter}/{letter}.py`

If you have issues running the notebooks, then try the following:

- Navigate to `tabula-rasa/py/sklearn/` in your terminal.

- Install and activate my [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) virtual environment by running

```
conda env create -f sklearn.yml
conda activate sklearn
```

- Use Jupyter Lab while your terminal is navigated to `tabula-rasa/py/sklearn/` to view the notebooks, i.e.

```
jupyter lab --no-browser
```

If following the above steps still doesn't allow you to run the notebooks, please let me know!
