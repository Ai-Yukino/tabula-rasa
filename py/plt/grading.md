# `tabula-rasa/py/plt/grading.md`

- Solution code you can run: `plt.ipynb`
- Non-interactive solutions with code output: `plt.html`
- [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) file format for good `git` version control: `plt.py`

If you have issues running the `plt.ipynb` notebook, then try the following:

- Navigate to `tabula-rasa/py/plt/` in your terminal.

- Install and activate my [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) virtual environment by running

```
conda env create -f plt.yml
conda activate plt
```

- Use Jupyter Lab while your terminal is navigated to `tabula-rasa/py/plt/` to view the notebooks, i.e.

```
jupyter lab --no-browser
```

If following the above steps still doesn't allow you to run the notebook `plt.ipynb`, please let me know!
