# `tabula-rasa/py/pd/grading.md`

- Solution code you can run: `py/pd/notebooks/##/##.ipynb`
- Non-interactive solutions with code output: `py/pd/notebooks/##/##.html`
- [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) file format for good `git` version control: `py/pd/notebooks/##/##.py`

If you have issues running then the `.ipynb` notebooks, then try the following:

- Navigate to `tabula-rasa/py/pd/` in your terminal.

- Install and activate my [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) virtual environment by running

```
conda env create -f pd.yml
conda activate pd
```

- Use Jupyter Lab while your terminal is navigated to `tabula-rasa/py/pd/` to view the notebooks, i.e.

```
jupyter lab --no-browser
```

If following the above steps still doesn't allow you to run the notebooks in `tabula-rasa/py/pd/notebooks/`, please let me know!
