## Import packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
```

## Exercise 1

### Familiarize yourself with the `heights` data set provided with the `modelr` package.

```{r}
data(heights)
heights
# ?heights
```

## Exercise 2

Create a list of formulas for modeling income with:
- `height`
- `height` $\cdot$ `weight`
- linear combination of all variables


```{r}
ggplot(data = heights, aes(y = income, x = height)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = heights, aes(y = income, x = height * weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
tb <- heights
tb$height_times_weight = tb$height * tb$weight

ggplot(data = tb, aes(y = income, x = height_times_weight)) + 
  geom_point()
```
